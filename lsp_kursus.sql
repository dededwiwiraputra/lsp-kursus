(1, 1, 'Generating Random Data into a Database Using Pythons', '<p>In this article we‚Äôre going to demonstrate how to generate dummy data and input for a MySQL database. Majority of the times we need to create a database to test some software that we‚Äôve built. To do this, we can use Structured Query Language (SQL) to create a mock database system. However, problems may arise if we want to test hundreds or even thousands of records. There is definitely no way we could write that many insert statements into our SQL scripts to meeting our testing deadlines for product deployment, that would be too tedious and time consuming.&nbsp;<br><br>To help with this problem, our trusty friend Python comes to assist !&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Python to the rescue !&nbsp;</strong><br><br>As you may or may not know python is a scripting language that is well known for its plethora (abundance) of libraries. Python is also known for its ability to automate task using its very simple syntax.&nbsp;<br><br>Pre-requisite Knowledge :&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Installation of python packages using pip.</li><li>Basic understanding of what databases are and how they use SQL.</li><li>Even if you don‚Äôt have what is required above, this article will ensure that you understand its content to help you further your Python career.</li></ul><p>So let‚Äôs get into it !&nbsp;<br><br>The python libraries that we‚Äôll be used for this project are:&nbsp;<br><br>Faker ‚Äî This is a package that can generate dummy data for you. We will use this to generate our dummy data.&nbsp;<br>Pandas ‚Äî This is a data analysis tool. This will be used to package our dummy data and convert it to tables in a database system.&nbsp;<br>SQLAlchemy ‚Äî This is an Object Relational Mapper(ORM) for SQL. ORM will be used as our database engine as it will provide our connection to our database.</p>', '658f784f65c29_andre-benz-qi2hmCwlhcE-unsplash.jpg', '2023-12-30 08:54:23', '2023-12-30 08:54:23'),

(3, 1, 'Generate Dummy Data With Faker', '<p>Fictitious data is required for a variety of purposes. Whether for testing, anonymising sensitive data, or adding ‚Äúnoise‚Äù to a training dataset, it can be beneficial to have access to a fake dataset in the same shape as the real data. You may also need to generate dummy data for testing and operational purposes. That is, to test what you have developed and how your code reacts to different types of input.&nbsp;<br><br>However, <i>finding the necessary data in a specific format we want can be difficult</i>. So, where do you get dummy data for your own application? There is an elegant solution to this problem in the form of the Faker package. With Python, you can use the Faker package to generate data according to your data needs. Faker is an open source library designed to generate different types of synthetic data.&nbsp;<br><br>In this article, we‚Äôll take a quick tour of Faker‚Äôs features and how to use them to create a dummy dataset.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Installation and Use&nbsp;</strong><br>Faker allows you to generate random data in dozens of languages. Since Faker is an open library for the community, it is constantly evolving. Providers ‚Äìgenerators specific to a certain type of data‚Äì are added regularly by the community. Let‚Äôs take a look at how to use it in terms of codes.</p>', '658f85d77ae56_wallhaven-5wvmq9.jpg', '2023-12-30 09:52:07', '2023-12-30 09:52:07'),

(5, 1, 'Why dummy data matters ‚Äì and how to generate it', '<p>Part of creating a successful Staging and Test environment for your application is generating dummy data as part of your deployment process.&nbsp;<br><br>This dummy data is used during development, the QA process and even for feature demos. Making it easy for application states to be achieved with minimal ‚Äúsetup‚Äù (that tends to be tedious, data-entry style work) increases productivity of the whole team.&nbsp;<br><br>In this article, we will explore two strategies for generating dummy data: using a ‚ÄòDummy Data Seeder‚Äô or ‚ÄòScrambling Production Data‚Äô.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Dummy Data Seeding&nbsp;</strong><br><br>I had once written an article entitled ‚ÄúThe Perfect Staging Environment‚Äù which explores this strategy in more detail.&nbsp;<br><br>The strategy&nbsp;<br><br>Create a seeder that leverages your existing Model Factories.

Avoid doing this: the configuration file ended up being more complex than what it replaced, rarely worked and wasn‚Äôt used.&nbsp;<br><br>Scrambling Production Data&nbsp;<br><br>This strategy leaves you with dummy data that is almost identical to your production data, except anonymised. For medium to large scale applications ‚Äì this is well worth the effort.&nbsp;<br><br>The strategy&nbsp;<br><br>Replicate your production database elsewhere&nbsp;<br>Iterate over all of your records, and apply a reasonable strategy to anonymise data&nbsp;<br>Use this database as your staging/test database&nbsp;<br>Automate this through a command, or as part of your post deployment script.&nbsp;<br><br>When to use this strategy&nbsp;<br><br>When the data you want to mock is quite complex&nbsp;<br>When you want to be able to test the exact state that a production user is in, in a test environment&nbsp;<br>When you expand the team to include a dedicated QA person&nbsp;<br>When you‚Äôd like to test using production data, without any of the risks (and in a GDPR-friendly way)&nbsp;<br><br>When not to use this strategy&nbsp;<br><br>When the application is small&nbsp;<br>When the person doing the testing is a developer, and can easily create different states&nbsp;<br><br>Lessons learned&nbsp;<br><br>Automate this process at the click of a button ‚Äì this is a task that needs to happen often (at least once per release, and at most ‚Äì every time a feature branch is deployed to a test or staging environment).&nbsp;<br>Depending on your strategies for 3rd party integrations your application might have, you may want to disconnect any production accounts as part of the scrambling process.&nbsp;<br>It‚Äôs useful to scramble user emails to match their ID, and to change everyone‚Äôs password to something easy to remember.&nbsp;<br>Test this solution in a real-world environment to avoid surprises (if you‚Äôd like to setup an export across servers then you‚Äôre going to want to see what the performance of that looks like!)</p>', '658f8d134522e_sopngqp8ruu11.png', '2023-12-30 10:22:59', '2023-12-30 10:22:59');
